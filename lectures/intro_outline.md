## intro

- we are all here because we have a shared interest in evo-devo and today’s session will add a third component: ‘eco' and the rise of 'eco-evo-devo' as a discipline in life sciences.

- How do we generally define evolution? 
--Evolution consists of changes in the heritable traits of a population of organisms as successive
generations replace one another (National Academy of Sciences, USA, 2015)

- This definition is heavily based on the principals of the modern synthesis
-- Populations harbour genetic variation that emerges randomly through mutation and recombination.
-- Populations evolve through changes in allele frequencies due to drift, gene flow, and especially, natural selection.
-- The majority of genetic variants have a small phenotypic effect, so that the resulting phenotypic changes are gradual.
-- Diversification occurs through speciation, which is mostly the result of reproductive isolation between allopatric populations.
-- These processes, operating over long enough timescales, give rise to cumulative changes of such magnitude that the resulting species are grouped at higher taxonomic levels.

- Under this framework, the environment largely acts as a passive filter. Changes arise (e.g. through mutation) and then the environment filters out the good from the bad.
- However, the environment is rarely a fixed variable, and we know that organisms have evolved many, often complex sensory systems for assessing their environment. Not just that, but they can adjust their behaviour, morphology and physiology based on these cues. 
- the phenotype is therefore critically, the result of an interaction between the genotype and the environment. 
- One could even go so far as to make a strong case that environmental input is essential in development.


- The environment can therefore be much more than just a passive sieve in evolution, because it actively impacts phenotypes on which e.g. selection ultimately acts.
- To try to better represent this the evolutionary thoery, a movement has proposed the "extended evolutionary synthesis".
- This includes eg. phenotypic plasticity, niche construction etc.

- A powerful tool for studying how environemnts influence phenotypes is RNAseq! 
- I assume that in the previous days you have had an introdction to the general principals, but i will very brifly explain this
- total RNA is extracted, mRNA is enriched and sequneced. Fragments are mapped to a reference and then you can count the expression.
- examples.
- In todays practical session we are going to explore one of our in-house examples:  pigmentation plasticity in tadpoles.
