## Blurb

In this practical session, we will be exploring how transcriptomics, specifically RNA-seq can be used to study phenotypic plasticity in non-model organisms. Our research group studies how the phenotype and development of amphibian tadpoles is influenced by different environmental factors, including predator presence, changes in hydroperiod and background colour.

We will be working through a hands-on example of how we go about evaluating data obtained from an RNAseq experiment. There is more material here than we can cover in this course, so feel free to explore this on your own time.  For expert tutorials and workflows I recommend [this tutorial](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) by the creater of `DeSeq2`.  

The practical sessions of this course will heavily relly on the `tidyverse` in R. This is a great tool that will make working with -omics data much easier. We go through a quick refresher to make sure we are all on the same page. However, for a much more in detail tutorial, I suggest [this R book](https://bookdown.org/ansellbr/WEHI_tidyR_course_book/) by Brendan Ansell.
